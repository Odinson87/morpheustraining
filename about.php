						I formed Morpheus in 2013, off the back of my first training consultancy,
						Peak Performance, formed in 1995. I guess I just enjoy helping people learn.
					</p>
					<p>
						I get a bit carried away with focusing on projects, which resulted in me buying quad bikes, canoes, archery kit and air rifles, to develop the team building side of the business - great fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						To feed all that, I believe I get my best energy from a good curry and a couple of pints of real ale - spot on.

						I've chosen this type of work because I love to see people grow and develop their confidence and 
                        ability.
					</p>
					<p>
						And of course it helps fund my travels to watch live football and cricket - nothing quite 
                        like being there and soaking up the atmosphere.

					Next stop, drinking lots of refreshing cocktails in the West Indies sunshine for the test match.
