			<h3>Leadership:</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li><b>To Lead:</b><br>Cause to go with by guiding or showing the way; direct the actions or opinions of others;</li>
			    <li><b>Leader:</b><br>A person followed by others</li>
			    <li><b>The Leadership Paradox:</b><br>Leading a team often means giving up power rather than accumulating it - the core issue for managing teams.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Traditional leadership skills of control, focus, responsibility, motivation, all help achieve business goals.
			</p> 
			<p>
				A leader that can encourage independent thinking, innovation and team member accountability, will be more able to face the challenges of the modern business.
			</p>
			<p>Leaders can be developed, and are not just born into leadership.</p>
