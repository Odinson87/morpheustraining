				    <h3>Sales Training Academy Layers</h3>
					<div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/sales_training_academy_layers.jpg"/></div>
					<p>
					    This is an overview map of how the Sales Academy has been constructed in a
						modular format, with 3 layers of skills and techniques, and bespoke modules 
						for different sales context situations:
					</p>
					<ol>
					    <li>Financial Services Sales</li>
					    <li>Product/Services Sales</li>
					    <li>IT/Technical Sales</li>
					    <li>Business 2 Business Sales</li>
					</ol>
                    <p>Sales Management Training is available for all these different contexts.</p>
                    <p>Each of these is broken down with highlight explanations under the headings below.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="item">
				    <div class="icon">
					    <img src="img/bdns/icons/base_layer_icon.jpg">
					</div>
				    <h4>Base Layer</h4>
					<div class="description">
						<div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/base_layer.jpg"/></div>
						<p>
						   The base layer is the first layer of selling skills and techniques, 
						   which all sales people have within them in varying degrees.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sessions are allocated to each of these areas, and cover the principles and techniques 
							to follow, and selling skills that need practice and development.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="item">
				    <div class="icon">
					    <img src="img/bdns/icons/intermediate_layer_behavioural_matching_icon.jpg">
					</div>
				    <h4>Intermediate Layer - Behavioural Matching</h4>
					<div class="description">
						<div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/intermediate_layer_behavioural_matching.jpg"/></div>
						<p>
						   The intermediate layer, assumes that attendees have completed the first base layer, 
						   as we now seek to build on this  - the purpose and goal being for the sales person, 
						   to modify their own behavioural style and approach to match and fit better to their target customer,
						   during a sales meeting.
						</p>
						<p>
						   Each of the base layer skill area techniques and principles still apply, 
						   and the sales person choses to control and direct their own behaviour by modifying to 
						   match the target customer preferences, and behaviour style. 
						</p>
						<p>
						   The model is a simple quadrant based approach, and is colour co-ordinated, 
						   to enable the sales trainee to identify clues and signals quicker, 
						   resulting in stronger rapport, more target questioning, client specific benefits, 
						   and closing techniques adapted to suit the target customer.
						</p>

				    <h4>Advanced Layer - Meta Programme</h4>
					<div class="description">
						<div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/advanced_layer_meta_programme.jpg"/></div>
						<p>
						   The advanced layer, assumes that attendees have completed both the first base layer, 
						   and the second intermediate layer as we now seek to build on both of these. 
						   The purpose and goal here is for the sales person, to understand how to modify their 
						   approach, skills and techniques based on a more in depth, psychological 
						   understanding of the target customer. 
						</p>
						<p>
						   The module is more about the reasons why customers <b>choose</b> approaches and behaviours, 
						   based on their values and frames of reference, using Neuro Linguistic Programming models, 
						   as the basic principles.

					<h4>Product/Service Sales : Get Buyers to Buy - Don't Sell</h4>
					<div class="description">
					    <div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/product_service_sales.jpg"/></div>
					    <p>
						   This element of the Sales Training Academy assumes that at least the first base layer of selling 
						   skills and techniques has been completed, and focuses on the difference between tangible products
						   and intangible services.
						</p>
						<p>
						   It encourages the sales trainee to see things from the buyer’s perspective, 
						   and to identify key features of their offering, 
						   that can be translated in to benefits, 
						   specific to customer circumstances and needs. 
						</p>
						<p>   
						   In addition, it challenges the sales trainee to identify unique selling points about their offering,
						   when they compare to their nearest competitor. 
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
						   All elements of the Sales Training Academy are designed to facilitate the sales trainee to be engaged 
						   and develop their own word patterns that suit them, and their sales environment and context. 
						</p>
						<p>
					       This element is particularly strong in challenging the sales trainee to develop word patterns 
						   that work for them.  
						</p>

    				<h4>Financial Services Sales</h4>
					<div class="description">
						<div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/financial_services_sales.jpg"/></div>
						<p>
						   This element of the Sales Training Academy assumes that at least the first base layer of selling 
						   skills and techniques has been completed, and focuses on the financial services market in particular. 
						</p>
						<p>There are two broad approaches to this element of the Sales Training Academy:</p>
						<ol>
						    <li>Sales Consultant Programme:
							    <br />This uses the 7 step sales model, tailored to advised or non-advised FCA regulated status.</li>
						    <li>
							    Sales Supervisor/Manager Programme:
								<br />This assumes completion and competency sign off as an authorised sales 
								consultant, and provides further competency sign off in a number of core supervisor skills:
								<ol>
								    <li>Objective observation and assessment using appropriate KPI assessment tools</li>
								    <li>Performance Analysis using appropriate KPI records</li>
								    <li>Feedback of KPI performance</li>
								    <li>Performance coaching of KPIs</li>
								    <li>Skills demonstration coaching of sales consultant standards</li>
								</ol>

								All of the above is tailored to the different business writing contexts of:
								<ol>
									<li>Mortgage business</li>
									<li>Life and income protection business</li>
									<li>General Insurance</li>
									<li>Mortgage and Insurance Broking</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>

				    <h4>Business 2 Business Development</h4>
					<div class="description">
						<div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/business_2_business_development.jpg"/></div>
						<p>
						   This element of the Sales Training Academy assumes that at least the first base layer of 
						   selling skills and techniques has been completed, and provides a rounded approach to selling 
						   in business generally, by working through sessions to:
						</p>
						<ol>
						    <li>Establish and define aims and sales goals, through construction of an annual business plan.</li>
						    <li>Reviewing your market environment, through construction of territory, time and activity planning, to produce the results required to meet your business plan.</li>
						    <li>Conducting prospecting calls to secure meetings and clients.</li>
						    <li>Conducting client meetings, using the 7 step sales model to apply appropriate sales skills and techniques.</li>
						    <li>Managing your follow up activity to ensure a healthy pipeline, and quality after sales service, supports the business plan goals.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
						   The Strategic Selling Skills module encourages the sales trainee to consider different strategies 
						   and approaches when seeking to win and keep business. This takes into account different buyer 
						   relationships and different decision maker influences within an organisation, as well as the 
						   current state of growth or decline in a client's business.

				    <h4>IT or Technical Sales</h4>
					<div class="description">
						<div class="image"><img class="h500" src="img/bdns/it_or_technical_sales.jpg"/></div>
						<p>
						   This element of the Sales Training Academy assumes that at least the first base layer of selling
						   skills and techniques has been completed, and is specifically designed to develop the presentation 
						   and sales skills of those involved in technical or IT sectors. 
						</p>
						<p>
						   Such sectors, often require demonstration of software functionality, and/or explanations involving
						   technical speak, or references, which need simplifying for end users, and buyers. 
						   This is usually about presentation skills, synchronised with equipment, 
						   but tailored away from many standard presentation skills training courses; 
						   these presentations need to integrate visuals, with client engagement as well as sales skills and 
						   techniques. 
						</p>
						<p>
    						The sessions are practically orientated, requiring sales trainees, to prepare and conduct sales
							presentation demonstrations to fit their own sales environment, for which guidance and feedback
							is given.
