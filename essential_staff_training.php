					<p class="overview">
                        Money Laundering is the generic term used to describe the process by which criminals disguise the original ownership and control of the proceeds of criminal conduct by making such proceeds appear to have derived from a legitimate source.
					</p>
					<div class="read_more">
						<h4>Aim</h4>

							</p>
						<h4>Objectives</h4>
						<p>
							To achieve this aim we will look at the following objectives:

							<li>Risk areas and how we can reduce them</li>

						</ul>
						<div class="read_more">
							<p>
								Money laundering means exchanging money or assets that were obtained criminally for money or other assets that are 'clean'. The clean money or assets don't have an obvious link with any criminal activity. Money laundering also includes money that's used to fund terrorism, however it's obtained.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Money Laundering Regulations apply to a number of different business sectors, including financial and credit businesses, accountants and estate agents. 
							</p>
							<p>
								You must put in place certain controls to prevent your business from being used for money laundering if you're covered by the Money Laundering Regulations.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Reporting suspicious activity:</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								You need to appoint a nominated officer (sometimes called the money laundering reporting officer) as part of the anti-money laundering controls that you have to put in place.
							</p>
							<p>
								You don't need to appoint a nominated officer if your business doesn't have any employees, because you're the person who is directly responsible for informing the National Crime Agency (NCA).
							</p>
							<p>
								Your nominated officer must be told if anyone in your business knows or suspects that another person is laundering money or financing terrorism
